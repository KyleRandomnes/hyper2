Referee Report


The referee's comments are preceded by a chevron (">") and my response
is included inline.  I have changed line-breaks in the interests of
clarity.

Overall Response

I am delighted that this insightful referee "gets" the manuscript.
The referee makes a number of observations and suggestions, all of
which I agree with, and I have made changes to the submission in
response, colour coded for ease of reference.  I have tried very hard
to preserve the brevity and pleasing structure that the referee
explicitly notes.  In short, the revised manuscript is a stronger and
more widely applicable document and I commend it to you.


Software implementation note

In the interests of full disclosure, I have made a significant change
to the C++ back end of the hyper2 package:

https://github.com/RobinHankin/hyper2/commit/d9d16c45daa752d4687446d7df9805439f461451#diff-25d902c24283ab8cfbac54dfa101ad31


The hyper2 package now uses player names as keys in the STL map class,
rather than integers.  The change is a conceptual streamlining which
results in simplified R idiom for a number of cases, but does not
change the mathematical basis of the software or alter any numerical
results.

An excellent observation.  In the chess world the pre-eminent strength
measure would be the Elo rating in which the winning player takes
points from the loser based on the pre-match difference in Elo rating.
Elo exhibits an emergent phenomenon in which sudden changes of ability
are not reflected instantly but have an exponentially damped response.

My view is that this damping feature is sometimes desirable (old games
are surely less informative than more recent ones) but uncontrolled in
the sense that the time-constant is not explicit or controllable, and
the Elo system uses an arbitrary points system with arbitrary cut-offs
[as opposed to the objective Bradley-Terry system].

I am in total agreement with this observation.  My thinking on this
issue has been strongly affected by my recent work applying
Bradley-Terry to Formula 1 motor racing.  In F1, drivers generally
start their careers as weak competitors, become stronger with
experience, and finally become uncompetitive due to age [although
frankly Lewis Hamilton at 35yo seems to buck this general trend, as
recent events in Tuscany would indicate].  I would suggest that chess
players have a similar career arc, although Formula 1 Teams typically
take a dim view of underperforming drivers---whom they rapidly and
unceremonially drop.  The career arc for these competitors would have
a truncated right hand side, unlike chess players who typically
decline gradually over decades [although I would observe that
Kasparov's current FIDE rating of 2812 is not that much less than his
peak of 2851].

Specifically, the dataset in question stretches from 1981 to 2017, a
very wide range.  Generalized Bradley-Terry, together with reified
entities, is capable of handling strengths varying over a career: one
would introduce a "mid-career monster", or perhaps an "experience
monster".  I would add here that monsters' strength is inherently
positive, so one could deal with waning strength with age by
introducing a "youth monster" who helps younger players.  But such
analysis is, I would suggest, firmly in the category of further work.
I have added a discussion of this issue to the manuscript (RED), in
two parts: firstly when introducing the dataset, and secondly under
Further Work.
