From the editorial team:

o The manuscript currently lacks a thorough software overview allowing the reader to assess which software packages (for R but also other software environments) are available providing related functionality and indicating how the presented functionality provides additional functionality.

o The manuscript could benefit from some restructuring to better guide the reader on available methods and implementations, the statistical methodology covered and extended and the specific computational implementation made. It would seem beneficial to entangle these different aspects as different readers might have differnt foci of interest and could thus better select on which parts of the manuscript to focus. The sections also currently seem to be a mix between different methods and illustrative applications. Again a thorough overview on the statistical functionality provided by the package in a separate section might ease accessibility for readers. Disussing specific computational aspects of the implementation in a separate section is certainly also of interest.

o Note that in R many functions providing ML estimates do not only return point estimates but either an object where then in an additional step, e.g., the Hessian can be determined as well as further information provided using summary / print etc., or directly have already an object returned which contains more information on the fit including also the log-likelihood attained, the model fitted, etc.

o As an example, methods(class = "PLADMM") in the PlackettLuce package lists: anova, deviance, fitted, itempar, logLik, predict, print, summary, vcov. The anova/fitted/predict might be specific to the regression case but the others might be useful for hyper3 as well. Similarly for btmodel() in the psychotools package and the eba package while BradleyTerry2, BTLLasso, PLMIX, and prefmod provide fewer methods.

o The NAMESPACE contains

exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")

Please avoid this and check if this can be removed or how it could be dropped.

It would seem that currently functions are exported which are not supposed to be directly called by the user, e.g., no argument checking. In this way they could be kept internal and documentation if desired could be provided with keyword internal to avoid cluttering the output of

help(package = "hyper2")


Manuscript style comments:

o Code should have enough spaces to facilitate reading.  Please include spaces before and after operators and after commas (unless spaces have syntactical meaning).

o The rule for capitalizing the starting letters of Figure, Section and Table is as follows: If you are referring to a particular figure/section/table then capitalize the first letter, otherwise use a lower-case first letter. For example, something shown in Section 4 vs. there are three sections in this paper.

o In all cases, code input/output must fit within the normal text width of the manuscript.  Thus, code input should have appropriate line breaks and code output should preferably be generated with a suitable width (or otherwise edited).

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.


References:



o Please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.
o All references should be in title style.
o See FAQ for specific reference instructions.


Code:

o Please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.
